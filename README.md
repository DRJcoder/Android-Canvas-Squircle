# Android-Canvas-Squircle
A FULL squircle for the Android Canvas, no tricks. You can customize it and modify it. 

This is a highly requested feature that hasn't been added to Android natively. 
After doing some research and looking up some formulas I finally managed to create a squircle. 

There's only one problem though, I've used the canvas API to draw a path based on the squircle fomula however, 
there seems to be a bug, or perhaps malusage of the Path API and I cannot fill it. 
If you find the solution I would highly appreciate it, right now I'm working on a separate project and I can't dedicate much time to this. 

Make sure to let me know if you used my code, I'd be excited to see what projects your're using it on!
And if you'd like to acredit me I would highly apreciate it. 

If you like this project and want to motivate me give it a star!

If you'd like to see how I use these two classes let me know.
