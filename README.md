A FULL squircle for the Android Canvas, no tricks. You can customize it and modify it. 

# Instructions

A library will come out with even more features this week!

Squircles are a highly requested feature that hasn't been added to Android natively, so here you have it, plain and simple and efficient. 

For now: 
To get it up and running all you have to do is download the two classes and save them into your project folders, where the Java or Kotlin files are, like regular classes. 
Once you do that you'll have access to the custom SuperEllipseView on your layout files, like a custom view. 
Then all you should have to do is replace a few things, like colors and package imports to your preference and needs. 

Squircles are a highly requested feature that hasn't been added to Android natively. 

Make sure to let me know if you used my code, I'd be excited to see what projects you're using it on!
And if you'd like to credit me I would highly appreciate it. 

If you like this project and want to motivate me, give it a star!
